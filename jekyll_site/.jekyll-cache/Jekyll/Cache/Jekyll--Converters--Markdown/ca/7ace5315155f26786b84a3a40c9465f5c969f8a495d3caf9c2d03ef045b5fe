I"õ<p>I am a Starting Research Fellow at the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/thoth/">THOTH team</a> of <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes">INRIA Grenoble - Rh√¥ne-Alpes</a> working with <a href="https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/">Julien Mairal</a>. 
Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</a> of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/">Arthur Gretton</a>.
I graduated from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">Ecole polytechnique</a> with a focus in Applied Mathematics and obtained a Masters Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision <a href="http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/">(MVA)</a> from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en">ENS Paris-Saclay</a>. I also worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at <a href="https://www.prophesee.ai/">Prophesee</a> where I developed tracking algorithms based on signals from neuromorophic cameras.</p>

<p>My research interests include Unsupervised Representation Learning, Non-convex optimization for Machine Learning and High Dimensional Sampling. I find problems arising from natural sciences and physics to be a great source of inspiration and a good way to find a balance between theory and practice.</p>
