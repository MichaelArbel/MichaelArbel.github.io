I am a Starting Research Fellow at the [THOTH team](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/) of [INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) working with [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/). 
Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) of [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/).
I graduated from [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) with a focus in Applied Mathematics and obtained a Masters Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision [(MVA)](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/) from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en). I also worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai/) where I developed tracking algorithms based on signals from neuromorophic cameras.

My research interests include Unsupervised Representation Learning, Non-convex optimization for Machine Learning and High Dimensional Sampling. I find problems arising from natural sciences and physics to be a great source of inspiration and a good way to find a balance between theory and practice.
